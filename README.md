# Encoder Testing
Playground for good ways to load data and test out an encoder based LLM router

## Updates
### 3/31
Goals:
1. Working MVP for getting an encoder with MLP to predict the class
2. Come up with 10 possible experiments based on literature review
3. Integrate with running on a server (maybe personal AWS)
